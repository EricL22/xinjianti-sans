# Source Han Sans
Source Han Sans is a set of OpenType Pan-CJK fonts. In addition to functional OpenType fonts, this open source project provides all of the source files that were used to build these OpenType fonts by using the AFDKO tools.
This particular build is completely independently developed from Adobe.
